Summary:

Porsche has patented an innovative six-stroke internal combustion engine design that aims to enhance power output and efficiency compared to traditional four-stroke engines used in most combustion-powered vehicles.

Key Points:

Traditional Four-Stroke Engine: Most internal combustion engines operate on a four-stroke cycle—intake, compression, power, and exhaust. Only one of these strokes (the power stroke) generates power.

Porsche's Six-Stroke Design:

Additional Strokes: The new design adds an extra compression and power stroke, resulting in six individual strokes divided into two sequences:
First Sequence: Intake → Compression → Power
Second Sequence: Compression → Power → Exhaust
Increased Power Production: By having two power strokes in every six strokes, the engine effectively increases the frequency of power generation from one in four strokes to one in three.
Special Crankshaft Mechanism:

Crankshaft Design: The engine uses a unique crankshaft that spins on a ring with two concentric circles (an annulus).
Piston Movement: This mechanism alters the piston's travel, creating two top and bottom dead centers. It changes the compression ratio and allows for the additional strokes without significantly increasing the engine's size.
Potential Benefits:

Enhanced Efficiency: More frequent power strokes could lead to better fuel efficiency and increased power output.
Thorough Combustion: The additional compression and power strokes may result in more complete combustion of the fuel-air mixture.
Innovation in Combustion Engines: This design represents Porsche's effort to keep internal combustion engines relevant amid the growing focus on electric vehicles.
Challenges and Considerations:

Complexity: The added mechanical complexity might pose challenges in manufacturing, maintenance, and cost.
Uncertain Viability: It remains to be seen whether the benefits outweigh the complexities and if the design will move beyond the patent stage.
Outlook:

Patent Possibility: As with many patents, the design may not reach production but showcases Porsche's commitment to engineering innovation.
Combustion Engine Future: The patent suggests that Porsche is exploring advanced technologies to improve combustion engines despite the industry's shift toward electrification.
Conclusion:

Porsche's six-stroke engine concept introduces a novel approach to internal combustion engine design by increasing the number of power strokes per cycle. This could potentially lead to engines that are more powerful and efficient. However, practical implementation would require overcoming significant engineering challenges. The patent highlights Porsche's dedication to pushing the boundaries of traditional engine technology in an era increasingly dominated by electric vehicles.
