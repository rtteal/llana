    "transcript": "John Carmack on Inlined Code\n\nFrom: John Carmack <john@idsoftware.com>\nDate: 16 September 2014\n\nThis is a topic that I feel strongly about. In general, inlining functions is a great way to improve performance. However, it is important to balance the benefits against the potential downsides, such as increased code size and reduced readability.\n\nThe concept of inlining functions is that, instead of making a function call, the compiler replaces the call site with the actual function code. This can eliminate the overhead associated with the function call. However, if a function is inlined too many times, it can lead to larger binaries and potential cache misses.\n\nWhen considering whether to inline a function, one should assess how often it is called and the complexity of the function itself. Simple functions that are called frequently are often good candidates for inlining. Conversely, more complex functions that are called less often may not be worth inlining.\n\nI also want to emphasize that inlining is not a silver bullet for performance. While it can yield significant gains in some scenarios, it can also complicate debugging and maintenance. Developers should consider the implications of their decisions and weigh the trade-offs carefully.\n\nCode Example:\n\ninline void MyFunction() {\n  // code here\n}\n\nvoid MyCaller() {\n  MyFunction(); // This call will be replaced with the actual code of MyFunction\n}\n\nIn summary, inlining can be a powerful optimization tool when used judiciously. Understanding when and how to use it effectively can lead to better performance in your applications, but it should be done with care to avoid the pitfalls of increased complexity and reduced maintainability.\n\nBest,\nJohn Carmack\n\nDate: 16 September 2014\n\n---",

He explores how inlining can influence optimization and code readability, providing insights on how developers should approach code structure and performance considerations.",
        "transcript": "John Carmack discusses the significance of inlined code in programming. He explains how inlining can improve performance by reducing function call overhead. However, he also warns about the potential drawbacks, such as increased code size and reduced readability. Carmack stresses the importance of understanding the trade-offs involved in using inline functions, especially in performance-critical applications. He provides examples and coding practices to illustrate his points.",
        "explanation": "Carmack's insights on inlined code highlight the balance between performance and maintainability in software development. While inlining can lead to faster execution due to fewer function calls, it may also result in larger binaries, which can affect cache performance. Developers are encouraged to consider context and specific use cases when deciding whether to inline code, especially in high-performance environments like game development."

In this work, we find that a floating point multiplier can be approximated by using integer addition with high precision. We propose the linear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating point number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm costs significantly less computation than the 8-bit floating point multiplier but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point multiplication, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes significantly less level-computation. Since multiplying floating point numbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition operations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can potentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor multiplications and 80% energy cost of products. We calculated the theoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide range of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language understanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question answering. Our numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical estimations, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissas achieves comparable precision as float8,48 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissas outperforms float8,52M. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that directly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless. We further show that replacing all floating point multiplications with 3-bit mantissas L-Mul in a transformer model achieves equivalent precision as using float8,4em3 as accumulation precision in both fine-tuning and inference.",

        "title": "Chemistry Nobel: Computational protein design and protein structure prediction",
        "summary": "The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded for groundbreaking advancements in protein science. David Baker is recognized for his work in computational protein design, while Dennis Hassabis and John M. Jumper are honored for their contributions to protein structure prediction using AI. These discoveries have significant implications for pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and understanding biological processes.",
        "explanation": "The Nobel Prize highlights two major advancements in protein science: the design of new proteins and the prediction of protein structures. David Baker's work allows for the creation of novel proteins with potential applications in medicine and technology. Meanwhile, the AI model AlphaFold, developed by Hassabis and Jumper, revolutionizes the ability to predict how proteins fold, which is crucial for understanding their function. Together, these contributions represent a leap forward in biochemistry, with vast implications for health and science."
